--------state-------

stateful protocol 
-> stateful protocol requires server to save the status and session information
eg: - ftp (file transfer protocol)

 stateless protocol 
  -> stateless protocol does not require rhe server to retain the server information
  eg: http


  express session 
  -> an attempt to make our session stateful


  -----authentication and authorization------

  -> authentication is the process of verifying who someone is .......

  -> authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications ,files ,and data a user has accesss to ........


  --- storing passwords---
  -> we never store the passwords as it is ....we stored their hashed form 

  -----Hashing function ----
  -> for every input , there is a fixed output 
  -> they are one-way functions, we cant get input from output 
  -> for a different input , there is a different  output but of same length
  -> small changes in input should bring large changes in output

  -> hashing fn example - SHA256, MD5, CRC

  -------salting --------

  -> password salting is a technique to protect passwords stored in databases by addinga a string of 32 or more characters and then hashing them

  ->Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular
   A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

   -> passport.session()
   - a web application needs the ability to identify users as they browse from page to page .... this series of requests and responses , each associated with the same user is known as session

   ->  in passport register method is used to save usename and password correctly

in passport  - we use pbkdf2 hashing algorithm
